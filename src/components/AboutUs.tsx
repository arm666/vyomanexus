          The journey of Vyoma Nexus Pvt. Ltd. began with a clear purpose—to
          engineer systems that empower, protect, and connect communities. But
          our roots go deeper.

          Our story started on January 2, 2018, as a retail business focused on
          electrical and electronic equipment. Through years of hands-on
          industry experience, market understanding, and trusted relationships,
          our business grew steadily—laying the foundation for something bigger.
